# NetCV
Welcome to the NetCV-Wiki! This is a Blazor Web App with SSR (server side rendering). Its purpose is to visualize my CV in a modern website. It uses the [Radzen](https://blazor.radzen.com/) component library for a clean and simple design. Feel free to clone the project and use it for your own website!
